## To do
- [ ] Check fillposlist stuff
- Don't remove completing edges from it
- [ ] Fix plane/edge gaps - must be in plane
- [ ] Revisit algorithm
- [ ] Fill in volume
- [ ] Have to delete blocks when changing next plane - in modify()

- Have to refactor this code at some point
- After this - planes, then done building for a bit, then interaction triggers, then painting and styling
- [ ] Can do stylistic fog for fun
