## To do
- [x] Check fillposlist stuff
- Organize
- Still may want to organize it into multiple functions
- [x] Fixed random plane problem I think - it was just a matter of moving the bulk of the pen mode code under the adjacentBlock check
- Don't remove completing edges from it
- [ ] Revisit algorithm
- [ ] Fill in volume
- Have to refactor this code at some point
- [ ] Constrain to plane

### Future
- Done building for a bit -> interaction triggers, then painting and styling
- Stylistic fog - shader research, read william chyr's blog
